# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to summarize the ride-sharing fare data by city type & display this summary in an easy to read graph. This will help us to anayze how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

From looking at the summary, we can see that there are more rides taken in urban areas which correlates with the highest number of drivers being in urban areas. Because there are more drivers available, the average fare per ride & per driver is the lowest in urban areas & the highest in rural areas (where there are fewer drivers).

## Summary
My recommendation to the CEO would be to find a way to incetivize more people to drive for PyBer in rural & suburban areas.
